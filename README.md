# Udacity-Investigate-a-Dataset-Project
Investigate a Dataset - Udacity Data Analyst NANODEGREE Project
## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze the tmdb-movies dataset and then communicate my findings of it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for making the analysis easier.

## What do you need to install?
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Why this Project?
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 
I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

## Files needed
tmdb-movies.csv

## Questions answered
- What is the relation between the budget and profit?
- Which year has the highest/lowest movie release?

## Observations
- There is a direct relation between budget, revenue, and profit.
- There is a direct relation between budget and profit.

## Conclusions
From the previous data analysis, I came out with this conclusions:
- High budget leads to high profit.
- The higher the budget, the higher the profit potential.
- Ranking of movies based on highest profit (Avatar, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Titanic, Jurassic World, Furious 7).
- Between 2011 and 2015, there was a severe decrease in the number of released movies.
- Arrangement of years according to the number of movies released (2011, 2015, 2012, 2013, 2014).

## Limitations
- In parsing the tmdb-movies dataset, the data is not up-to-date, it is also incomplete and has missing values.
- The currency unit is not provided, so I assume it's the same unit, which can lead to a huge error in data analysis.
